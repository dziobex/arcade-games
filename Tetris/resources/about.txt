From Wikipedia: Tetris is a
tile-matching video game created
by Alexey Pajitnov in 1984.
Player has to complete lines
by moving differently shaped
pieces (tetrominoes),
which descend onto the playing
field.
The completed lines disappear
and grant the player points.
The game ends when the playing
field is filled.
